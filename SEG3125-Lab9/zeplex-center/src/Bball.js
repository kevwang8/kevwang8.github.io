            <p>The Zeplex community is where new or old friends can connect in the timeless sport of basketball. 
                Young or old, competitive or beginner, all players are welcome and embraced by Zeplex. You will be joining and learning from some of Ottawaâ€™s top ranked 
                basketball players who have a passion in teaching the sport.
                </p>
            <p>Zeplex offers different programs for all occasions. If you want lessons throughout the year, we have many great programs for players starting out their basketball journey as well as intermediate players who want to
                take their game to the next level. If you only have the time in summer break, we offer state of the art summer camps that have helped players extend their basketball skills in only 2 months. Beginner summer camps are also
                a great way for kids to have fun, stay active, and get introduced to the world of basketball.
